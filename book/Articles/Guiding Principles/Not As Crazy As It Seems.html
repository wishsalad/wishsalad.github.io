<p>20210324143936</p>
<p>If you read the articles and the other content in this book, at some point, you will inevitably come to a conclusion: <strong>This is crazy!</strong></p>
<p>And you would be right. Well, sort of. Or maybe not at all.</p>
<p>I've invested countless hours thinking about this problem and designing a solution that, while ambitious, is not as crazy as it seems at a quick glance. Here you can find some of the reasons why.</p>
<p>The first thing you will notice is that I'm trying to replace most apps with the WishSalad medium. Not only that, I want it to work everywhere, desktop, mobile, VR, ...</p>
<p>But wait, I'm also trying to replace the web, the social networks, and countless other services with the WishSalad communities.</p>
<p>And if that wasn't enough, I want to develop new mental tools and a new culture for the communities. So that we can all do better in our personal and shared stories.</p>
<p>How can I not see that this is crazy?</p>
<p>There are two kinds of reasons, some are technical, and others are about strategy.</p>
<h2 id="technical-reasons"><a class="header" href="#technical-reasons">Technical reasons</a></h2>
<p>As big as the WishSalad medium seems, most features emerge without difficulty from a core system. And I've put great effort into designing a minimal core system composed of very few pieces.</p>
<p>It has been a lot of work to simplify the design, iteration after iteration, always trying to do more with less. But after many years of distilling the core concepts, I'm convinced the simple ideas that form the core of WishSalad are up to the task.</p>
<p>And by no means think most work is already done. This is just the beginning. The core has few pieces, but they are all very technically challenging. </p>
<p>During these years, I've learned in depth about all the areas required for the core and prototyped countless solutions.</p>
<p>A great high-level design means nothing without the technical knowledge to implement it. And many times, discovering what's possible in the implementation can guide you to a better general design.</p>
<p>And, as with any research project, most of the things I've tried have failed. What remains are the things that have passed the test of time.</p>
<p>After this journey, I'm convinced that implementing the core ideas of the WishSalad medium is feasible. It might require a long time from a single person. It might even require a small team. But it's not an absurd amount of work, in part thanks to the work others have put in great libraries.</p>
<p>Apart from that, on a technical level, many things can be implemented incrementally once the bases are there. The core, and everything on top of it, will never be finished. And can be incrementally be improved over time.</p>
<h2 id="strategic-reasons"><a class="header" href="#strategic-reasons">Strategic reasons</a></h2>
<p>But the difficulties with such a big project are not only about creating a great product, as there are many strategic factors to take into account too.</p>
<p>The mainstream approach in situations like this is to create a startup and try to find investors. This would pay for the development and promotion of the product. But this is a terrible strategy for the WishSalad project.</p>
<p>First, because users need to control their tools. And that means the WishSalad medium must be an open-source product. And open-source products, unlike services, cannot provide the crazy returns investors want.</p>
<p>But we can see this from the other side too. Having an open-source product makes it much more attractive to users, helping adoption.</p>
<p>The other problem with startups is they require rapid growth to satisfy the investors. Here, again, we go in the opposite direction with an incremental adoption strategy. We will see below what that means.</p>
<p>The last difference with startups is long-term sustainability. The idea in startups is usually to grow fast or die fast. And even if you survive, it's considered a success to be acquired by a larger company that will completely transform or even end the product.</p>
<p>But this goes against the WishSalad project goals. Because without long-term sustainability, it's impossible to keep providing users with the tools that they need.</p>
<p>Moving to the WishSalad medium is a long-term investment. Once you try how good things can be, you won't want to go back. But this requires the guarantees that long-term sustainability and an open-source product provide.</p>
<p>This long-term investment is what can drive users to support the project and make it sustainable. But this is not something that can be improvised, and it needs to be part of a larger strategy.</p>
<p>Now let's move to the incremental adoption strategies we introduced before.</p>
<p>A big part of the WishSalad medium is about helping you with shared stories. Share stories live in communities, and they share many features with current social networks. And in particular, they share something called network effects.</p>
<p>A product depends on network effects if the value you get depends on the number of people using it. That means established products give you more value than new products, even if they are worse. And for a new product, breaking this negative loop is really difficult.</p>
<p>The strategy we take to solve this problem is to create value for the user outside of the communities. The WishSalad medium is designed to be much better than the current medium, even if you are the only user.</p>
<p>The strategy is to drive adoption from individual users that use it for themselves. And once they are already using it, the network effects kick in. </p>
<p>The WishSalad medium would be even more valuable to them if others used it. Therefore they have an incentive to promote it.</p>
<p>And there are no barriers for these new users to adopt it because they can profit immediately. Even if the only other user they know is the one that introduced them to the product.</p>
<p>We have turned the negative loop into a positive one. Early adopters are rewarded and help drive growth.</p>
<p>This solves the problem with the network effects. But what about the issue of moving to a new medium? If users need to leave everything they use behind, that's going to make adoption extremely difficult.</p>
<p>The strategy here is again incremental. You can move into the WishSalad medium little by little and still get the benefits where you use it.</p>
<p>But the incremental strategy goes farther. The WishSalad medium can integrate with the old medium to enhance it and make it more useful. Of course, always within the constraints of what the old medium allows.</p>
<p>This strategy also allows incremental development, as you don't need all the features and integrations from day one. You just need a good enough core that can support healthy growth and adoption.</p>
<h2 id="realistic-after-all"><a class="header" href="#realistic-after-all">Realistic after all</a></h2>
<p>I hope I've changed your mind, and you can view this project as something reasonable now.</p>
<p>All the hard work, the countless redesigns, the time spent looking for better strategies, ... it has finally paid off.</p>
<p>The WishSalad medium design is simple enough to be feasible to develop and maintain. The principles and strategies that guided the design can create a positive feedback loop for its adoption. And it doesn't seem as crazy anymore.</p>
<p>The transition into a new medium is essential and unavoidable if we don't want to be stuck with a technology that limits our potential. And the WishSalad medium is a realistic way to get there.</p>
